# Canvas based game - RADIUS

A small browser based game I made a while ago. To learn more about canvas.

I wanted to try out some ideas on a canvas based game
- radius changing according to the size of radiuses of other elements.
- game resising changes the gameplay.
- points somehow linked to the radius of the targets.
